                    Han was born in Incheon, South Korea, however at the age of 9, he moved to Malaysia where he was home-schooled.
                    He has an older brother who is not known, and has a pet male Bichon Frise named <b>Bbama</b> which meant crimp in korean.
                    Thus, Bbama was named so.
                    At 16, he came back to South Korea to pass the Korean GED. He thought if he went back to Malaysia, 
                    he would never get the chance to become a singer, so he made a deal with his parents that if he doesn't 
                    get into an agency within a year, he would go back to Malaysia to study.
                    He is currently enrolled at Gukje Cyber University under the Department of Entertainment Studies.
                    Han and his friend auditioned for a company one morning, and heard about a monthly JYP audition taking place as well. 
                    They went there to see if they could spot a celebrity, but eventually, 
                    Jisung participated in the audition and passed with rapping.

                    Seungmin was born in Seoul, South Korea. He has an older sister that is 7 years older than him.
                    He was introduced to baseball by his grand-father. He dreamed of becoming a baseball player so he 
                    worked hard for it but he had to stop because of an injury and other problems.
                    Still, he liked singing ever since he was little. In the fourth grade of elementary school, 
                    he went to a nursery rhyme contest, won a prize, and joined a choir. 
                    In middle school, when he was thinking about what he should do to be happy in life, he thought about "music", 
                    so he studied and practiced singing to appeal to his parents.
                    He learned English when he went to Los Angeles for 3 months and he graduated from Cheongdam High School.
                    Seungmin likes to mess with I.N because he wanted a lot of dongsaengs. Since I.N is the only one, he likes to mess with him.
