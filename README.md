# FED Assignment1
My project is a website that is for new people who are looking to get to know the Korean K-pop boy group Stray Kids better.
It is to promote the music and content from the group and the members who are in the group. As there is a rise in K-pop acts, K-pop groups are all trying to grow their fandom.
My website is what would allow people who do not know the band, but are interested to learn more about the band, to become fans. My project may also allow people who were already fans to learn things they did not already know about the group. 

This website would share who are the members, what awards and achievements they have won, and what music and content they have put out. This would allow newer fans to also use the website as platform to easily access videos and music of the group. This allows the group to gain more streams for their music videos and increase monthly viewerships. 
Most people who are interested in k-pop groups are usually very overwhelmed by how much information there is to take in when learning about them, as such this website is a short and simple way to let such people learn about the group.

# Design Process
The design of the web page was inspired by the colour scheme of the group's recent comeback. The colour scheme of the group's recent comeback is hot pink, as such, i have used different shades of pink as the background colour and the colour for different buttons and the navigation bar.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

The above links are wireframes used initially to idealise what i want my web pages to look like.

# Features
Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users to click on a button which would add increments of 1 when more users press the button from other devices. this is a counter which allows the fans to see how many people has visited the page and became a fan or wwant to become a fan.

Feature 2 - there are social media handles of the group's different social media platforms which would bring the user to a new tab when they tap to open it without needing to right click.

Feature 3 - there is a navigation bar at the top of the page which allows users to navigate through the different pages of the website.

Feature 4 - there are drop down lists that allow users to jump to different sections of the page. for example, the "Contents" page have different series of content in one page. users may use the drop down list to jump to a series they specifically want to find which allows them to have easier accessibility. the drop down list also has a fixed position so that users can use it whenever they want as it would not disappear.

Feature 5 - embeds of the groups albums have been used to allow users to have an easier time testing out songs that may interest them as they are able to play and listen to the songs straight away. this allows users to have easy access to the music of the group.

Feature 6 - embeds of the group's content is also used to input videos which can be watched on the same page. this allows users to easily watch what the different kinds of content the group offers are like and allow them to judge whether it is enjoyable enough for themselves.

Additional features to be implemented in the future:

Feature 1 - a to the top button which allows users to get back to the top quickly as there are pages which are quite lengthy and may cause users some inconvenience.
