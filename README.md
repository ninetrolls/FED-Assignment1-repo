My project is a website that is for new people who are looking to get to know the Korean K-pop boy group Stray Kids better.
It is to promote the music and content from the group and the members who are in the group. As there is a rise in K-pop acts, K-pop groups are all trying to grow their fandom.
My website is what would allow people who do not know the band, but are interested to learn more about the band, to become fans. My project may also allow people who were already fans to learn things they did not already know about the group. 

This website would share who are the members, what awards and achievements they have won, and what music and content they have put out. This would allow newer fans to also use the website as platform to easily access videos and music of the group. This allows the group to gain more streams for their music videos and increase monthly viewerships. 
Most people who are interested in k-pop groups are usually very overwhelmed by how much information there is to take in when learning about them, as such this website is a short and simple way to let such people learn about the group.
